                          MODULES
Getting other functions from a diffrent file is possible by importing it
at the top of your file you want to add  "import `file name`" then 
use " print (filename.function_you_want())"

link for modules that were already created that you can use
prewritten code of functions 
https://docs.python.org/3/py-modinex.html

installing python docs
PIP is used to install python modules
You can check if you have PIP type "pip --version"
TO INSTALL:
    pip install module-name.docx

"site-packages" is where it would be stored when being a third party

                    INHERITANCE 
creating a class that has functions:
    class Chef:
            def make_chicken(self):
                print("The chef makes a chicken")

            def make_salad(self):
                print("The chef makes a salad")

            def make_special_dish(self):
                print("The chef makes bbq ribs")

Now go to the file you want to import this class into

from Chef import Chef

myChef = Chef()
myChef.make_chicken()-----this will print the prompt

Maybe we wanna make a class that defines a new type of chef, new file
    class ChineseChef:
        def make_chicken(self):
                print("The chef makes a chicken")

            def make_salad(self):
                print("The chef makes a salad")

            def make_special_dish(self):
                print("The chef makes orange chicken")
            def make_fried_rice(self):
            print("The chef makes fried rice")

now you go back to your file where you want to import the file
from Chef import Chef
from ChineseChef import ChineseChef

myChef = Chef()
myChef.make_special_dish()

myChineseChef = ChineseChefChef()
myChineseChef.make_special_dish()

instead to copy from the original chef you can INHERITANCE
from Chef import Chef

class ChineseChef(Chef):
    def make_special_dish(self):
        print("The chef makes orange chicken")
